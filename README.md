# ESAMU - ESPORT AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

It is quite obvious that there is a close relation between esport and artificial intelligence. 
This relation is further enhanced by our research which tries to focus not only on using the 
artificial intelligence but on creating it in a new way. Our idea is to develop a new 
developmental robotics and robopsychology based game called Samu Entropy as a social robot 
that will be implemented by software on the familyâ€™s home desktop and mobile devices.
