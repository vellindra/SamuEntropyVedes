        <title>Foreword</title>
        <para>
            If you are a child under age 12, you can skip this boring foreword, we didn't devote it to you but your mentor. Of course it's not problem if you read over, just don't fall asleep meanwhile, because it's about a further future that is still completely unconcerned for you.
        </para>
        <para>
            The book consists of two parts, the first one &#x2013; anticipating for a few's pleasure &#x2013; C++ programming, the programming of the present. The second one is the possible programming exercise of the future, when we already don't program in the classic manner, but only play. Since it's a game (esport), here massive amount of readers can be counted on.
        </para>
        <para>
            Once my hacker friend expounded to me that the programming as an activity can't be algorithmic, therefore it's not teachable. There is only one possibility: encourage the ones that are interested in programming to program and the wonder happens by itself: some becomes programmer!
        </para>
        <para>
            We feel this creed as ours, too. However, in this document we still try to teach programming the children under age 12 in language...
            <systemitem class="systemname">C++</systemitem>. We deal with this in the first part, but we don't wait for the wonder from this but from the second part, where we introduce &#x2013; according to our vision &#x2013; the programming of the future.
        </para>
        <para>
            What is this vision?
        </para>
        <para>
            When I was in highschool, I started to use a computer <footnote>
                <para>Commodore 64, Balassi Bálint High School Balassagyarmat, thanks to István Fűrész informatics teacher, I started to like programming, too.</para>
            </footnote> and I had two relationship with it: I programmed and I played games on it. These two activities had one same part, for example when I defined over a 8x8 bytes character to a person and in my own &#x201E;game,&#x201D; it moved on a screen... but the game and the programming was two different thing and still is.
        </para>
        <para>
            But would it different in the future? In our vision will be places where not! For example different programming tasks with a cognitive character belonging to the area of artificial intelligence eg. machine vision when the machine is not only processes the images, but at similar level also can answer questions like people, what is depicted in the picture!

            And what is Samu Entropy's vision?

            How are we doing? The first part is easier: the children (Gréta 8, Nándi 8 and Matyi 10 years old) they arrive home from the swimming train after 6 pm, they have dinner, then everyday we discuss one C++ source and of course we try it. They describe in their own words for the next day and they send me them in e-mail, and I get into this book &#x2013; at least this is the ideal plan. :)
        </para>
        <para>
            The second part would be more complicated, because that &#x2013; after Dénes Gábor &#x2013; you have to invent. We trying to make a publication named &#x201E;Entropy non-increasing games for improvement of dataflow programming&#x201D;.
        </para>

            Next up is the glossary, which is still more tuned to the mentor as a child reader.
