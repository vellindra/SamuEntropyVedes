                        It is true for the programmer, too, that generally he/she stands on the shoulders of giants <footnote>
                            <para> The great scientist, Isaac Newton wrote this (in his letter written to Robert Hook) to express that he could also build upon the work of others:
                                "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants".
                            </para>
                        </footnote>, in other words, he or she reuses other programmers' programs.
                        The <code>#include</code> command does exactly this, it pastes the
                        <code>iostream</code> programs written by others. In this <code>iostream</code> there are programs that materialize the channels. For example your program will have a channel<footnote>
                            <para>Where does this channel come from? On your machine (or for example on your phone or even on your tablet) there is a special program, called
                                the operating system, the Linux kernel, which Linus Torvalds started to write when he was on a university in Finland.  The operating
                                system is a good friend of the programmer, this program guarantees fro example these channels, too.
                            </para>
                        </footnote>, whereto your program sends the letters, and these letters will be displayed on the screen.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The basic foundation of a <systemitem class="systemname">C++</systemitem> program is the function, this has a first line,
                        which is now the <code>int main()</code> line. This is made of three parts: it tells what the function will calculate: this is now
                        a number, the <type>int</type> keyword means this. The second part is the name of the function, this in our case is
                        <code>main</code>. The third part is written between parentheses: the function receives what is here, it has to calculate from these
                        . In our case this part is empty, in other words we didn't give the function anything as an input.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The body of the function is the block, which is a list of commands written between curly braces. Every command ends with a semicolon.
                        We have now two commands. The first one is the one called <varname>std::cout</varname> which prints the
                        <literal>"Hello, Vilag!"</literal> text to output channel. The input part of this channel is in our program and the output part is opened to the screen.
                        Then we print a special signal, which makes the cursor jump to a new line on the screen.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        The second command is the <code>return</code> which gives back the value calculated by the function to the caller of the function.
                        We didn't calculate anything now, only printed to the screen, so we returned 0. This means by convention that everything was okay with the program,
                        because the caller of your <function>main</function> function was the operating system itself,
                        the kernel of the Linux, the program indicates that it didn't have any problems.
                        With this, the <function>main</function> function ended and with that our program finished.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Now let us try out the program!
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        First, we translate the source code so that the processor of our machine understands it.
                        We save this translation in the greta1 file with the <application>g++</application> compiler. Then by writing its name after the dot slash
                        we run the compiled program. Running a program is the process when the processor reads the compiled program.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        What happened after pressing enter after typing dot slash and the filename? The main function was executed, which printed
                        the Hello, World! text to the output channel, which was therefore displayed on the screen.

                            The machines do not understand the various <systemitem class="systemname">C++</systemitem> source codes,
                            but the <systemitem class="systemname">C++</systemitem> programmers do!
                            The source code must be compiled to the processor's own language. This is executed by the <application>g++</application>compiler program
                            <footnote>
                                <para> The g++ compiler was written by a famous programmer who has a well-known hacker name: RMS, in other words Richard Matthew Stallman.

                            Your mentor can show you what the language that your processor understands actually looks like: it is made of numbers. Here is for example the runnable code

                            Previously we saw the contents of the <filename>greta1</filename> file with the <command>hexdump</command> command:

                            In the world of C programming, it is even more of a daily routine to check what you have to use in the manual and see how you can make it work!
                            This is a written profession, it was not given to us by God, it was invented by engineers, this is the simple truth: you only have to read it.
                            For example take a look at what the manual says about the <varname>std::cout</varname> object:

                        The <varname>cout</varname> is a channel for letters to cross it.
                        The <code><![CDATA[<<]]></code> means that push the letters in this direction. The 0 means that the main function was executed properly.

                        The <varname>iostream</varname> is a channel.
                        The <code>int main</code> is the main function.
                        The main function is called by the operating system.
                        The function means that it is a building block of the program.
                        <code><![CDATA[std::cout << Hello World << std::endl]]></code>
                        This means that we print the letters to the channel.
                        The <constant>std::endl</constant> means that the cursor goes to the next line.
                        The <code>return</code> returns a number to the caller of the function.
                        The <code>return 0;</code> means that the program finished successfully.

                        With the <code>for</code> statement we can repeat things, in other words we can make iterations in our program. The iteration means that
                        we execute something (the thing that we iterate) over an over again, multiple times (it can even be 0: 0 or infinite).

                        In the second source we iterate a whole number <code>int i</code> starting from the value of <code>i=0</code> (initialising) and we continue until it is true that
                        <code><![CDATA[i<3]]></code>, so the i variable takes on the values 0, 1 and 2, printing them in this order.

                        The i=0 is where the iteration starts, the <code><![CDATA[i<3]]></code> shows how long it will iterate and the ++i shows by how many it increases on every iteration.

                        On paper we discussed briefly that the first number changes just like the for loop variable i, the other number is always 7, in turn. We can define the latter one for example as <code>int m = 7;</code>. We talked over the printing separately, that the first number is always i, the second one is m, the third one is the multiplication of the two, i.e. later at the computer we can write something like this: <code><![CDATA[cout << i << "*" << m << i*m << endl;]]></code>.

                        On the other hand what are the tracking messages showing? What happened? The <literal>third</literal> Soldier object (<literal>Giant</literal>) put down the <literal>me</literal> (<literal>Nandi</literal>) object. Then the already weakened <literal>me</literal> Soldier object (<literal>Nandi</literal>) put down the <literal>against</literal> object the (<literal>Barbarian</literal>).
 Then the two winners: <literal>against</literal> and <literal>third</literal> plays, where <literal>third</literal> wins. Well, we didn't really count on this, did we?

                    <para>
                        The explanation: We thought when we played it through in our heads that first the <code>fight(me, against)</code> happens, then the <code>fight(me, third)</code> and in the end the two winners will play. There is a chance that a computer exists on which it will happen like this, but mine is not that computer! That's because the C++ language does not determine the order of the function call's ingoing parameters. In our case that the external fight function could start with either the right or the left side's fight call's execution. Because it is not determined that it will happen like this on the first computer and like that on the other one. That is the reason why we are on slipper ground. What can the programmer do? What does the programmer have to do? He has to avoid to write sources in which situations like this could appear. For this there are many opportunities, it's only questionable in style that which one will the programmer use. Right now it's enough to know that the C++ is not a playground (for example the Java or C# is) in the meaning of the programmer shouldn't only know properly what will the effect be of his programme on the objects in the memory will be, he HAS to know it perfectly!

                    <para>
                        The code will be much more readable if we remove the function calls from the function call, so we write this:

Attempt after attempt, but much to the delight of them, once the <literal>Gr√©ta</literal>, once the <literal>N√°ndi</literal> object won, and of course few times the <literal>Matyi</literal>'s fight with itself came back till he realized that there are tasks which are impossible to solve within given borders. (Because if Matyi loses the first match then he won't go alive to the second one so he won't get into the finals. If this wouldn't happen, so he wins the first but fails the second then he would get to the finals but well... not alive.)
